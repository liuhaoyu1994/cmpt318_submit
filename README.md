A  model to predict the weather condition in Vancouver based on Kat Kam image from Downtown Vancouver

## Overview

The study on Big Data in Image Recognition and Weather Prediction is to help to release of the labour force and improve the efficiency of labelling weather. Our purpose is to find out the best model to predict the weather condition in Vancouver based on Kat Kam's image from
Downtown Vancouver. Weather data are retrieved from YVR airport weather station and images are taken by webcam in Downtown Vancouver. After applying data cleaning, statistical analysis and image processing techniques, we finally find out a satisfiable model which can be trained to predict weather

## Installation 

There are three codes show our work: get_dataframe.py, build_model.py, project_analyzation.ipynb.
get_dataframe.py generates a dataframe contains features of images and corresponding weather labels.
build_model.py reads the generated dataframe, builds and trains a model, returns score of the model.
The selection of the model we used in build_model.py is based on our tests for different models and parameters in test.ipynb.
Model with highest score will be selected. project_analyzation.ipynb shows our progress on testing data and training models.
Put project_analyzation.ipynb and image_labeled.csv under the same directory in Jupyter will allow it to run normally.  
1. Required libraries:
	get_dataframe.py requires following libraries: pandas, numpy, cv2, glob, sys, re.
	build_model.py requires following libraries: pandas, sys, sklearn

2. Order of execution: execute get_dataframe.py, then execute build_model.py

Important!!!!!!!!!!!: **Execution of get_dataframe.py may take about 2 hours to finish.**
		      We have provided the output dataframe under the given folder named 'image_labeled.csv'.
		      Please just execute build_model.py with provided dataframe to save your time.
		      Execution of build_model.py takes about 3 and a half minutes, please be patient on execution.		      	

3. Commands:
	Run 'python3 get_dataframe.py yvr-weather katkam-scaled' to execute get_dataframe.py
		Check following before execute: Provided folders 'yvr-weather' and 'katkam-scaled' are in same directory with get_dataframe.py
	Run 'python3 build_model.py image_labeled.csv' to execute build_model.py
		Check following before execute: Provided file 'image_labeled.csv' are in same directory with build_model.py 

4. Files produced/expected:
	get_dataframe.py returns a csv file, 'image_labeled.csv' under the same directory.
	build_model.py will print the score of the chosen model for this problem.
